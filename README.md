# LANGUAGE-TRANSLATION

This is a Machine learning project, it is developed Language Translator model using a many-to-many encoder-decoder sequence model.
We will train our model using LSTM which will convert English to Hindi language where English will be input text and Hindi will be the target text. 
For this, we will be using English-Hindi dataset.
LSTM stands for Long Short Term Memory networks 
Lstm is a special type of Rnnâ€™s which has a long-short term memory.the name itself indicates that it can handle long-term dependencies and short-term dependencies
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is specifically designed to handle sequential data, such as time series, speech, and text.
LSTM networks are capable of learning long-term dependencies in sequential data, which makes them well suited for tasks such as language translation, speech recognition, and time series forecasting.
